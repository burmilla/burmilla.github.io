# Adding the BurmillaOS Image into Aliyun

BurmillaOS is available as an image in Aliyun, and can be easily run in Elastic Compute Service (ECS).  Letâ€™s walk through how to upload the ECS image.

1. Download the most recent BurmillaOS image. The image `burmillaos-aliyun.vhd` can be found in the [release artifacts](https://github.com/burmilla/os/releases).
2. Follow Aliyun's instructions on how to [upload the image](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/127285.html). Before the image can be added, it must be uploaded into an OSS bucket.
3. Once the image is added to your ECS, we can start creating new instances!

Example:

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Root disk size | The size must be greater than 10GB. Note: When booting the instance, the value must be kept the same. |
| Platform |  Select `Others Linux` |
| Image Format | Select `VHD` |

### Launching BurmillaOS using Aliyun Console

After the image is uploaded, we can use the `Aliyun Console` to start a new instance. Currently, BurmillaOS on Aliyun only supports SSH key access, so it can only be deployed through the UI.

Since the image is private, we need to use the `Custom Images`.

After the instance is successfully started, we can login with the `rancher` user via SSH.
