After creating your own custom service, you can launch it in BurmillaOS in a couple of methods. The service could be directly added to the cloud-config, or a docker-compose.yml file could be saved at a http(s) url location or in a specific directory of BurmillaOS.
Launching Services # Using Cloud-Config # If you want to boot BurmillaOS with a system service running, you can add the service to the cloud-config that is passed to BurmillaOS.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://burmillaos.org/docs/system-services/environment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://burmillaos.org/docs/system-services/environment/</guid><description>Environment # The environment key can be used to customize system services. When a value is not assigned, BurmillaOS looks up the value from the rancher.environment key.
In the example below, ETCD_DISCOVERY will be set to https://discovery.etcd.io/d1cd18f5ee1c1e2223aed6a1734719f7 for the etcd service.
rancher: environment: ETCD_DISCOVERY: https://discovery.etcd.io/d1cd18f5ee1c1e2223aed6a1734719f7 services: etcd: ... environment: - ETCD_DISCOVERY Wildcard globbing is also supported. In the example below, ETCD_DISCOVERY will be set as in the previous example, along with any other environment variables beginning with ETCD_.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://burmillaos.org/docs/system-services/system-docker-volumes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://burmillaos.org/docs/system-services/system-docker-volumes/</guid><description>System Docker Volumes # A few services are containers in created state. Their purpose is to provide volumes for other services.
user-volumes # Provides user accessible persistent storage directories, used by console service:
/home /opt /var/lib/kubelet If you want to change user-volumes, for example, add /etc/kubernetes directory:
$ sudo ros config set rancher.services.user-volumes.volumes [/home:/home,/opt:/opt,/var/lib/kubelet:/var/lib/kubelet,/etc/kubernetes:/etc/kubernetes] $ sudo reboot Please note that after the restart, the new persistence directory can take effect.</description></item></channel></rss>
